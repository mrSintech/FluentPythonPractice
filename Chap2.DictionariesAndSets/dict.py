# We use dictionaries in all our Python programs. If not directly in our code,
# then indirectly because the dict type is a fundamental part of Python’s
# implementation. Class and instance attributes, module namespaces, and
# function keyword arguments are some of the core Python constructs represented
# by dictionaries in memory. The __builtins__.__dict__ stores all built-in
# types, objects, and functions.

# Because of their crucial role, Python dicts are highly optimized—and continue
# to get improvements. Hash tables are the engines behind Python’s
# high-performance dicts.
