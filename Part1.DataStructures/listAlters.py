# The list type is flexible and easy to use, but depending on specific requirements,
    # there are better options.
    
# ARRAY: array saves a lot of memory when the sequence is too large.

# DEQUE: if you are constantly adding and removing items from opposite ends of a list, 
    # itâ€™s good to know that a deque (double-ended queue) is a more efficient FIFO data structure.

# SET: f your code frequently checks whether an item is present in a collection,
    # set is a good choice, especially if it holds a large number of items.
    # sets are optimized for fast membership checking.
# NOTE: set is not a sequence.
